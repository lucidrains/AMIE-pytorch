## AMIE - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of the general framework for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00099-4">AMIE</a>, from the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05654">Towards Conversational Diagnostic AI</a>, out of Google Deepmind

Reach out to me if you are at least a 3rd year medical student, have kept up with the current state of deep learning, and interested in this project.

## Todo

- [ ] allow for a DPO-like formulation. do not think google deepmind has adopted this across the org just yet.
